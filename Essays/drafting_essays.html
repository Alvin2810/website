  <h3>Drafting Essays</h3>
  <p> The first attempt in writing an essay is always a draft. This section provides with guides on writing introductions and conclusions, paragraphs and using linking words
  and phrases.</p>
  <h4>Writing Introduction and Conclusion</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Every piece of formal writing that you complete must contain a clear introduction and conclusion. The introduction prepares the reader for what they are about to read and
       the conclusion summarises the content of what you have discussed. <br> While writing an introduction and conclusion, the guidelines presented below needs to be followed.</p>
    <h5>Introductions</h5>
    <div>
      <h6>An introduction should include the following:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Background information</li>
        <p> This is normally two or three sentences which gives the reader a general information about the topic that you are writing about.</p>
        <li>Thesis statement/topic</li>
        <p>This is the most important part of the introduction. It introduces the main topic or argument on which the essay will be based.</p>
        <li>Outline</li>
        <p>The outline tells the reader what the sub-topics of the essay will be and in doing so how the essay will be organised.</p>
        <li>Scope</li>
        <p>This section is only required if you are going to narrow your discussion of the topic down e.g. to a particular time or place.</p>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h5>Conclusions</h5>
    <div>
      <h6>The conclusion usually starts with ‘In conclusion’, or ‘To sum up…” and it should:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>Restate your thesis or the main idea of the paper</li>
        <li>Give an outline</li>
        <p>This provides a summary of the sub-topics/issues covered in the essay</p>
        <li>Qualify your thesis</li>
        <p>Review the thesis statement acknowledging significant counter evidence if necessary.</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <h4>Drafting Paragraphs</h4>
  <div>
    <h5>What is a paragragh?</h5>
    <div>
      <p>A paragraph is a group of sentences that relates to a certain theme or idea. The length of a paragraph may vary, but the average paragraph should be between 80-120 words long.</p>
      <p>Ideally, a paragraph should have a beginning, middle and an end. This should include a topic sentence which is the main idea or theme of the paragraph, supporting sentences which provide further information and explanation of the main idea and in some cases a concluding sentence. (This concluding sentence is not always necessary but in longer paragraphs it does help to add clarity and strength to your discussion).</p>
